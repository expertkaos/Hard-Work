			<p>So far in my project, I have figured out how to handle an LCD, display the desired text, and receive a
				signal from an Arduino to control a device like a servo. The next step is to learn how to communicate
				between two Arduinos quickly and reliably. I have set a goal to research the type of communication I
				will be using, how it works, and which module I should purchase. By the end of this week, I plan to
				order two communication modules to begin working with them next week.</p>

			<p>The first thing I did this week was watch YouTube videos of other people's Arduino RC projects, as many
				online resources are available. After looking at multiple, I came across the same type of communication
				used across most of them. This is the nRF24L01, for which I have linked a website from which I got most
				of my learning. The nRF24L01 is a low-power wireless transceiver module that operates at 2.4GHz and is
				popular for Arduino projects due to its efficiency and ease of use. It supports data rates of up to 2
				Mbps and offers a range of about 100 meters in open spaces, which will be plenty for the plane as we
				will mostly fly it in open fields such as an oval. With features like multiple communication channels,
				auto-acknowledgement of packets, and a simple SPI interface (Serial Peripheral Interface) for
				communication, which is straightforward to implement with microcontrollers like Arduino, the nRF24L01 is
				a versatile solution for my project.</p>
			<p>There are multiple variations of the nRF24L01 series, all with different capabilities, the most common
				being the nRF24L01, nRF24L01+, and nRF24L01P. The standard nRF24L01 offers a range of about 100 meters
				and operates at a data rate of up to 2mps. The nRF24L01+ improves on this with a longer range of up to
				1000 meters and includes features like a low-dropout regulator and dynamic payload length. Finally, the
				nRF24L01P has all the enhancements of the plus version but offers even better power-saving features and
				reliability in tougher communication environments. Each version is designed to cater to different needs
				in wireless communication applications.</p>
			<p>
				After considering all my options, I searched on Amazon for the nRF24L01 to get it as soon as possible.
				Initially, I was only looking for the nRF24L01+, but I came across a great bundle that included two
				nRF24L01 modules and two nRF24L01+ modules, all at a much lower price than other alternatives. Although
				the base nRF24L01 would suffice for my immediate needs, I realized that investing a little more for the
				enhanced versions would benefit my future projects. Ultimately, I concluded that having better quality
				modules would make me much happier and provide more versatility for upcoming applications.

			<h3>What new insights did I gain this week?</h3>
			<p>I learned much about the nRF24L01 wireless transceiver module, such as its capabilities, variations, and
				advantages for Arduino projects. Understanding its features, like multiple communication channels and
				the SPI interface, was crucial for my project development. </p>

			<h3>How did I prioritise my tasks this week?</h3>
			<p>I prioritised learning about communion options first since they are essential for the next phase of my
				project. I then focused on finding a good bundle for the nRF24L01 modules to ensure I had the needed
				parts without overspending.</p>

			<h3>What strategies did I use to stay motivated?</h3>
			<p>I stayed motivated by setting clear goals, such as researching communication types and ordering the
				necessary modules by the end of the week. The anticipation of progressing my project kept me engaged and
				excited to work on my project.</p>
