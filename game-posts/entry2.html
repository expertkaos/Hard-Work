			<p>Although this week was not my most productive, I was sick for half of it, and even after I got better, I
				had a migraine. I still attempted to work to the fullest ability I could. At the beginning of this week,
				I wanted to finish the projectile logic and write so that the projectile size and speed can easily be
				changed depending on the player's class. However, I got distracted from my goal of finishing the
				projectile logic rather than continuing to work on the overall looks of my game because I decided to
				work on my assets more. I, therefore, ran out of time for my original goal.</p>

			<p>This week wasn't a total waste of time but a useful lesson that I need to consider for my future making of this game. The goals are great. They give you an objective and a moving force to continue with a project. Still, when I set my goal, I had trouble handling the challenge acutely, as I found it too difficult. Therefore, I impulsively worked on something I could hold better, which, in this case, was working on my assets.
				With that, my assets' progress marginally changed, but I advised my knowledge of the visual side of unity. I learned that although I am working with 2D, you can still have the third axis, so you can add fog so the further stuff from the camera will be foggier; this can be done with shades, which I have learned about in the previous week. You can add a colour or an image to a spirit, but they can often be flat. This is where you can use shaders to change certain covers, add a glow, add an outline, and, as previously stated, add a fog effect; these shades can be made in either text or nodes. I haven't yet played with shades much, but I am very excited to see what they offer in the future.

			<p>This week, I added a wake effect to my boats. I completed this by making a simple gradient in Photoshop with black on two ends, slowly getting lighter as they move inwards. I added this gradient to a prebuilt trail method and tweaked the values until I was happy with it; I'm hoping that I will be able to use shaders to make the wake look better. </p>
