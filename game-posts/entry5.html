			<p>We have been getting ready for ICAW (in-class assessment week), which will take place in two weeks.
				Gaming genres and their classification will be the main topics of our test. Over the next two weeks, we
				will thoroughly study game genres and genre categorisation to prepare for the test.</p>

			<p>We were given a document covering what we would have to do this week. This task involves researching
				three games made after 2010 from different genres to understand their origins and creation process. The
				three games that I chose to look into and write about were Minecraft, Fortnite and The Witcher 3, each
				covering a different genre.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><b>Minecraft:</b> The game revolutionised the sandbox genre by allowing players to create their
						environments and experiences. It popularised early access games and proved game success without
						flashy graphics or complex mechanics. Minecraft was originally an independent title made by
						Markus "Notch" Persson before being bought by Microsoft in 2014. In the past, there have been
						sandbox games that used a random generator to create the game, like Dwarf Fortress (2006), but
						Minecraft brought it to a new level of freedom. Before creating Minecraft, Persson developed
						multiple small games. He knew he wanted to be a game developer from an early age. He spent much
						of his early life making games, including Reverse, which created the Doom engine. He produced a
						2006 video game called Wurm Online, a sandbox game. Persson's previous dedication to the game
						development department helped him develop Minecraft.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><b>Fortnite:</b> The game revolutionised the battle royale genre. It introduced in-game events
						like concerts and unique game modes. It changed how free-to-play games make money by introducing
						the battle pass. Epic Games is the game company that developed Fortnite. Epic Games had
						experience making games before Fortnite but never created a battle royale game, as it was still
						a new gaming genre. As the power of the internet improves, more multiplayer games are made to
						allow more people to play a game. Epic Games took advantage of this and created a game that
						combined 100 real-time players to create a thrilling experience. Epic Games had been developing
						their gaming engine, 'Unreal Engine,' which helped develop Fortnite.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><b>The Witcher 3:</b> The game transformed open-world RPGs with its captivating story, intricate
						characters, and immersive world, emphasising the importance of player choice in storytelling.
						The Witcher 3 is part of a franchise made by CD Projekt. Because The Witcher 3 was not the first
						of the franchise, CD Projekt had some practice with the type of game and already having a game
						engine already developed.</p>

			<p>This week's learning method is quite different from the last few years of doing IT. Previously, I've just
				been making examples with code or doing grok exercises. But this week, I have used more of a theoretical
				learning method. This method teaches me things that I would only learn if I learned.</p>
