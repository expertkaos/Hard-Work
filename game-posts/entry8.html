			<h2>Entry 8</h2>

			<p>This week, we continued discovering and dissecting the theory of what makes a game suitable and enjoyable
				for the right audience. We also discussed the three games we analysed a few weeks ago as a group. After
				that, we started to look at motivation and satisfaction in video games. I also studied and wrote about
				the game Warframe, looking at the motivation and the satisfaction of the game.</p>

			<p>As a class, we looked into motivation and satisfaction regarding games. Within the class, we covered what
				makes a game enjoyable and how the thrill of achieving a goal gives the motive to play, called the
				motivation and satisfaction cycle. To keep the player involved in a game, they would need to want to
				play it. All games have a reward when something is completed, usually in the form of achievements,
				awards, badges, or trophies; on the other hand, rewards do not need to be represented as badges or
				unlockable achievements; instead, they simply actions that deliver a feeling of fulfilment and
				accomplishment.</p>

			<p>Motivation and cycle are the processes a game must follow to make it more fun. Motivation is a desire to
				achieve a need; in this case, we want the motivation to be to play the game and continue to do so. The
				cycle of motivation begins with a need, which causes a drive fed by the incentive to reach the goal that
				fills the need.</p>

			<p><b>NEED --> DRIVE --> INCENTIVE --> GOAL</b></p>

			<h3>Where did you encounter struggles, and what did you do to deal with them?</h3>
			<p>During the group discussion of the games we researched, I learned I needed to understand better some of
				the games others discussed. I handled this problem by noting what games others mentioned, doing some
				background research, and watching or playing the games to understand better the game style and how the
				player progresses.</p>

			<h3>What's the purpose of this?</h3>
			<p>I find it pretty easy to make a game, but it is hard to make it fun to play and to make the game so
				individuals will be motivated to play; this is where I think what we are learning will take place
				without knowing what motivates someone, it will majorly disadvantage the quality and success of the
				game.</p>

			<h3>What have you taken away from this week?</h3>
			<p>This week's information gave me a new perspective on how games are made. In the past, I only considered
				the physical parts of a game, which made the game functional, like player movement, an ending goal, and
				enemies or obstacles to make the goal more challenging. The game functions are still essential because
				there would be no game without them, but focusing more on players' motives for playing the game opens a
				new perspective on the game-making industry for me.</p>
