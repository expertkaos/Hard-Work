			<P>This week marked the final week of the year, which meant it was my last opportunity to complete my
				project. I started the week with only my terrain created in World Machine, and by the end, I had
				developed a fully detailed environment complete with objects, water, and moving elements. At the
				beginning of the week, I made a list of everything I needed to accomplish before submitting my work.
				Initially, I thought I would only need to import my terrain and a few assets and write my report.
				However, I soon realised this process took much longer than anticipated.</P>

			<p>This week, the first practical task I completed was importing my height map from World Machine into
				Unreal Engine. I was able to do this quickly because I have done it before. However, after the import, I
				realised I wasn’t satisfied with the terrain. It didn’t look realistic, and the texture was off. I spent
				quite a bit of time tweaking settings in World Machine. While watching tutorials, I came across another
				program called Quadspinner Gaea 2.0. this application was practically the same as World Machine but had
				some slightly different functions I used this to add two textures, the sand and the stone. I decided to
				do this because when I just had the sand texture, I could have any step angels without the steering
				looking out of place and feeling mushy. I pulled through the height map from my world machine. I changed
				a few things; the most significant thing I did was change it to a more jagged rocky form, then use the
				snow node to add a smooth layer on the top to make the texture look more like sand. I also created an
				indent for my lake that I planned to add to Unreal Engine 5.</p>
			<img class="small-img" src="game_evidence/entry_30/evidence_3.png">
			<p>The visual quality significantly improved after importing the updated terrain into World Machine.
				However, I was still unsatisfied with the texture; it was a low-detail bitmap that depended on the
				texture from the actual height map. That's when I discovered the MW Landscape Auto Material, which was
				quite impressive. It worked similarly to the colouriser in World Machine but provided additional
				features, such as pebble textures and a more intricate overall texture. It also included optimisation;
				for instance, more detail loads in as you get closer to it. This functionality is particularly useful
				because if I decide to sculpt within Unreal Engine 5, the texture will automatically update accordingly.
			</p>
			<img class="small-img" src="game_evidence/entry_30/evidence_4.png">
			<p>After this, I made good progress on my project. The next step was adding water, but I encountered much
				trouble and frustration. I searched for a tutorial on how to add water to UE5 and found a short YouTube
				video. The tutorial recommended using the water plugin; however, it wasn't very helpful because it
				didn't clearly explain the process. I spent a few hours trying to get the water feature to work, but
				eventually, I figured it out. After that, I could move on to adding assets to my project. I used two
				different textures for the ocean and the lake, using free assets from the UE5 marketplace.</p>
			<p>After reviewing the required elements for my project, I realised I still needed to add a path and a dry
				forest. I searched for free resources on the Unreal Engine Marketplace and 3D models for Blender to find
				suitable assets, knowing I could import them into Unreal. Previously, I had added some assets to my
				Unreal library, including a Greek island with several components that would be useful for my project.
			</p>
			<p>I imported these assets into my project and integrated them into the environment by strategically placing
				them and sculpting the terrain to fit them. Additionally, using this asset pack, I changed the ocean
				texture, modified the lighting, and positioned a light source above the statue on the masa to create an
				appealing effect.</p>
			<p>To create the trail, I used a spline path to connect a line of planks, allowing me to weave it around my
				terrain. This method was quite effective because even if the planks did not sit flush against the
				ground, I could partially bury them to make it look like the sand had been brushed against them. I also
				used a spline path to make the sharks circle the boat in the water.</p>

			<h3>If I were to redo this project, how would I approach it differently?</h3>
			<p>While working on this project, I spent hours on something and did not have much to show. I could be
				working on one thing for a long time, doing little tweaks and restarting over each time, getting better;
				I find a premise this is a good thing to do, although I need to balance perfection within the time
				frame. With this product, I spent a lot of time on the simple shape of the terrain without leaving time
				for the elements my project required to include. I could work on one thing for ages, trying to make it
				perfect, while sometimes it is best to move on with good and work on the other stuff; doing this will
				allow me to balance my time since I only have a certain amount of time to complete my task I first need
				to get make an ok result that is submittable then if I have the time I can further improve my project
				this approach of balancing my time between task will also help with my other classes because I won’t be
				spending as much time on the one class. I have found that this often happens when I fixate on one task
				and forget about the others and later realise that I need to do those tasks and spend a lot of time on
				the other task only to get an ok result and drain even more of my time.</p>

			<h3>How did my skills with the software improve during this project?</h3>
			<p>In the past, I have not had the greatest experience learning Unreal Engine 5. However, I completed daily
				tasks and used other game-making software, such as Unity, which helped me get into UE5 faster than I
				would have otherwise. This familiarity with Unity allowed me to spend less time developing certain
				skills I would have needed to learn from scratch.</p>
			<p>Regarding the terrain generator, World Machine, I had almost no experience with the software at the
				beginning of the semester. However, I spent a week exploring it after seeing it listed in the class
				outline. My pre-existing knowledge of nodes from UE5 and Blender also helped me get started quickly.
				While these experiences allowed me to begin more efficiently, they did not significantly impact my
				overall results because I only knew the basics of these topics.</p>


			<h3>What was my original vision for the project, and how did it evolve while working on it?</h3>
			<p>My initial vision for the project was to depict dunes leading into the sea. However, I encountered
				difficulties integrating other elements, such as a mesa and a peninsula. Consequently, I revised the
				design to feature a rocky landscape with sand, which proved much more effective.</p>
			<p>When I started, I was excited to work on a project because I found it far more enjoyable than simply
				reading documents. I believe that practical experience is the best way to learn. Initially, I thought my
				idea of using World Machine was outdated and that I wouldn’t need to learn it. However, as the week
				progressed and I integrated it into Unreal Engine 5—a game engine that can utilise terrain like this—I
				discovered its usefulness and capabilities. Even though World Machine is older software, its visual
				quality can be enhanced with other tools. The shape of the terrain created with it will remain relevant
				for a long time.</p>
