				This week, we were assigned a new assessment task that we will be doing for the next few weeks. The task was to design a game and make a prototype of it.

				For this week, I brainstormed on my game idea and started making the baseplate for the game.

			<h3>Game concept</h3>
		
			<p>
				The concept of my game is that you are a space miner exploring distant planets for valuable 
				resources. You aim to collect as many rare minerals as possible while avoiding hazards and alien 
				creatures. The game will have a clear exploration cycle, mining, and rewards.
			</p>
			<p>
				The player will do runs of exploring plans and trying to get as many resources as possible for each 
				run.  After the player crashes, runs out of fuel, or mines all of the planets, they will return to a shop 
				where they can tack their rewards and trade them into upgrades to improve their ship and do 
				upgrades such as faster movement, better shields, better drills and a larger fuel tank. The further 
				the player goes out from the start, the better the reward from the planets will be. While the player 
				explores and mines planets, they can encounter obstacles such as black holes and asteroids when 
				exploring space. The player also will need to conserve their full each run.
			</p>
			<p><b>Game Cycle:</b> Exploration → Mining → Rewards → Upgrade.</p>
			
			<h3>Beginning of game process</h3>
			<p>
				Before I did anything, I needed to know what game I wanted to make. I found lots of inspiration in 
				‘cool math games’; these games often lack great detail in the graphics or components but still are 
				fun to play and have a decent amount of playtime, so I discovered they were a perfect place to start 
				getting game ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to use the same type of game cycle that ‘Awesome Tank’ and ‘Learn to Fly’ have. The cycle 
				allows a lot of playtime without making lots of different components. How they work is that there is 
				a main game or main objective, and the player is trying to achieve that goal; after the player dies or 
				achieves the purpose, the player receives currency that they can spend on upgrades so that next 
				time, they can do better and achieve more reward. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At first, I did not have a full grasp of what I wanted my game to be, so I decided to start coding it so 
				that when making it, the idea of it would be on my mind, and the concept could develop while also 
				progressing the game.
			</p>
			<p>
				To start a game making a game, the very basics need to be made before focusing on the actual 
				game cycle. So, I started just by adding the basic movement of the spaceship.
				After making the pygame screen show up, I then made the player sprite that will be able to move 
				around the screen. I wanted to make the player’s movement satisfying so the player would enjoy 
				flying around space. The movement went through multiple generations before I was happy with it. 
				To begin, I just made the player move up, down, left, and right on a grid using the arrow keys, but I 
				found this way too rigid and would not allow the player to slip past the enemies; after making that 
				movement mechanic, I thought of the cool math game doge that is a game when s sprite follows 
				the mouse while trying to dodge obstacles weaving through them and giving a satisfying thrill to it. 
				When I implemented this in my game, the player had no restrictions on the speed at which the ship 
				could go. I wasn’t happy with the movement that I currently had, so I kept on thinking. I landed on 
				the concept of the ship rotating left and right and a thruster to move the ship forward. This alone 
				would not be enjoyable because the ship would rigidly move around to fix this. I added that the x 
				and y velocity would stay the same unless the thrusters pushed against it. I added acceleration to 
				the ship to gradually go faster with a certain speed cap.

			<h3>What is a possible error for the future of this project?</h3>
			<p>
				I had never made a game like this before, so I had to do a lot of research to find ways to do 
				things. This is fine, but when coding, there are many different ways to do the same things. 
				When finding many other sources to do various things, some components might overlap while 
				doing a different method. Although my current code works, they won’t work together cleanly 
				in the future; while I try to add more parts to the game, I can see it getting harder and taking 
				up more of my time. What I have taken away from thinking about this is that it works better 
				together before I start to vary my code.
			</p>
			<h3>What insights or lessons have I gained from the progress I’ve achieved so far?</h3>
			<p>
				I have found that the idea of my game has developed throughout, making the game's base. 
				When coding, I kept thinking about the game and where to go with it. I changed many things 
				because when I started, I did not have a full idea of what it was about. This decision resulted in 
				many setbacks in progress but ultimately resulted in a better version. I believe if I had not 
				started making the game this week, my idea would not have progressed and would still be a 
				simple thought.
			</p>
			<h3>What about my learning has brought the most satisfaction? </h3>
			<p>
				This week, I’ve made significant progress. The moment that brought me the most satisfaction 
				was when I finally discovered solutions to challenges within my game's code. Learning new 
				methods and creating an enjoyable game, even Without a specific objective, the game has 
				been incredibly rewarding, and I'm satisfied with how it works.
