			<p>This week marked the beginning of the new term, and we have a new project for the year. Our assignment
				aims to help us develop our skills, and we will maintain a log of our progress in this blog. We were not

				will help us understand the discussion necessary for developing our projects.</p>

				to complete this task effectively.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, this week we were assigned tasks for later in the week, and I was away on a family trip
				for the entire weekend. As a result, I completed less work than I would have preferred. However, I found
				that I used my available time productively, which helped me achieve my goal for this week.</p>
