		<div class="body" id="overview">
			<p>This week marked the first week of a new semester. With that, I had the option to either continue my
				project from the previous semester or start a new one. Looking back on my old project, I found that I
				was upset with the game concept. Ultimately, it was merely a poor imitation of the game rounds. I could
				fix this problem and take the game into a completely new direction. Still, at this point, the game
				wasn't giving me enough motivation to continue with it, so I have decided it would be a better idea to
				create a new game with a completely new concept and with this, I can use the knowledge that I learnt
				while making my previous game to make this one even better. That led me to where I am now: what will be
				my new game?</p>
		</div>

		<div class="body" id="content">
			<p>I began brainstorming game ideas and started thinking about games that I like and enjoy. Looking at games
				that I enjoy provides a foundation for my thoughts, while also allowing me to create a game that I am
				passionate about. This knowledge of the game genre comes from my enjoyment of it.</p>
			<p>I had this idea for a game inspired by "Bob the Robber," but with a fun twist: instead of stealing stuff,
				you’re actually returning it. I thought it would be hilarious and would give the character, a former
				criminal, a chance at redemption. But then I hit a snag with the gameplay. Unlike the usual sneaky
				grabbing of valuables, returning items just didn't seem as exciting. I played around with the idea of
				using outlines to show where to put things, but that felt way too limiting and might take away from the
				fun. So, after thinking it over, I decided to ditch the idea and move on to something new.
				So I went back to the drawing board.
			</p>
			<p>So I went back to the drawing board.
			</p>
			<p>To get inspiration, I looked through my Steam library and checked out games I've been sinking the most
				hours into lately. Two stood out immediately: DayZ and Sons of the Forest. Something cool about survival
				games that has always intrigued me is that all survival games at their base are the same, managing
				stats, upgrading gear, crafting tools and armour, staying alive; they all do it in their own ways, which
				makes each one unique and fun in its way.
			</p>
			In Dayz, the story is more in the background. It's a zombie apocalypse with a heavy PvP focus. You're
			constantly on edge, scavenging and trying to survive while avoiding (or confronting) other players, and when
			you do, your heart will race faster than you could imagine. It's chaotic, unpredictable and honestly,
			stressful in a good way. I focus heavily on trying to survive.
			</p>
			<p>While Sons of the Forest, on the other hand, leans much more into the narrative. Sure, you still have to
				scavenge and survive like in Dayz, but here’s also a stronger sense of mystery and story progression
				that keeps you hooked differently.</p>
			<p>And then there's another game I've been playing recently: Subnautica. It's also a survival game, but it
				stands out for its focus on exploration, crafting and base building within a completely different
				environment compared to other survival games out there, due to it being purely set underwater. There’s a
				bit of story in there, too, but the way it balances survival and creativity makes it satisfying to play.
			</p>
			<p>Out of all three, Subnautica is one I enjoy most, especially when I think about it from a game
				development perspective. The building aspect, in particular, really appeals to me. </p>
			<p>After putting my understanding on survival games and what I like about them, I've settled on the idea of
				creating a survival game that focuses heavily on crafting and scavenging, which appeals to me about the
				building aspect. To make my game unique, I envision a time traveller who can only go back in time and
				has found themselves stranded on a prehistoric Earth. In this world with no agriculture, players will
				need to craft tools and survive, using a survival guide device that you had with you when you fell back
				in time, but also your time machine that you can use to get out of tricky situations, solve problems
				that may be scattered around the map.</p>
			<p>The rewind time mechanic could be cool, but because it will take up so much time, I want to focus on the
				game basics of a survival game. Then once I have that, I can move on to creating a story, working on
				time travel mechanics.

			<h3>What made me curious about my game idea, and how can I explore that curiosity further?</h3>
			<p>What made me curious about my game idea this week was the concept of time travel and how it could change
				the mechanics of a survival game. I started to think about how I could implement the time machine
				mechanic to create interesting puzzles throughout the game. Additionally, I considered how it could be
				used as a tool when fighting enemies.</p>
			<p>When thinking about enemies, I imagined them as cavemen, dinosaurs, or animals that lived alongside
				primitive humans. With this in mind, I can explore multiple ways to utilise the time machine and see
				what works best, including whether I need to implement a cooldown period for its use.</p>



			<h3>How am I using what I learned from last semester to improve this semester?</h3>
			<p>This semester, Im taking what I learned last semester and using it to step up my game. I’m excited about
				the idea of creating a 3D game, which is a change from my previous work, but through this experience, I
				have picked up some skills from making other games. I've learnt from last semester that it is important
				to be passionate about my game and have a good understanding of what I want to create. This is why I
				fully dedicated myself this week to form a clear idea of what I want to do before even touching the game
				engine.</p>
