			<p>This week marked the first week of a new semester. With that, I had the option to either continue my
				project from the previous semester or start a new one. Looking back on my old project, I found that I
				was upset with the game concept. Ultimately, it was merely a poor imitation of the game rounds. Although
				rounds was a game that I was basing mine off I didnt stear far enough away from the idea to make my own
				game and the only thing I realy changed was that I made it local multiplayer which make the game play
				worse because you ended up having to aim with keys I could try to fix this problem and take the game
				into a complete new direction. Still, at this point, the game wasn't giving me enough motivation to
				continue with it, so I have decided it would be a better idea to create a new game with a completely new
				concept and with this, I can use the knowledge that I learnt while making my previous game to make this
				one even better. That led me to where I am now: what will be my new game?</p>

			<p>I began brainstorming game ideas and started thinking about games that I like and enjoy. Looking at games
				that I enjoy provides a foundation for my thoughts, while also allowing me to create a game that I am
				passionate about. This knowledge of the game genre comes from my enjoyment of it.</p>
			<p>When thinking about game titles, Bob the Robber came into my head. Bob the Robber was a simple game I
				used to play on a website. The concept of the game is that you are a robber and must retrieve the safe
				and return it to its original location while avoiding detection. This game initially seemed like one I
				would love to have, with the same concept, so I began to think about what my game would be like. I had
				the idea of a reverse robber game. I loved this idea; it was a funny twist that I could put into a
				classic robbery game. The idea allowed me to incorporate a level of storytelling that I had not
				previously achieved. As the character was a former criminal, I could mitigate the consequences of his
				actions by returning the things he stole. After some more thinking and chucking more ideas around on why
				the player would be giving stuff rather than taking, I eventually found that although the concept of
				reverse robbery is fun and different, it created some issues when I started thinking about the actual
				game aspects and how it would play, with having reverse robbery than you will have to put things into
				the building the problem with this is when you are taking stuff out than its very simple sneak in
				without getting caught than grabbing as much as you can than leave by finding valuables the problem with
				giving back is that you dont have the aspect of finding valuables.</p>
			<p>Having this thought prompted me to look more closely at the way the game plays rather than the story. At
				one point, I came up with the idea of giving each object a sort of outline, a visual guide or highlight
				to make it clear where the objects should be placed. The outline would fix the problem of where to put
				something, but as I thought about it more, it didn't feel immersive, and would make the game feel like
				you're just doing what the game tells you to do, which, alternately, would make the game experience
				worse. After sitting on the game's development, I eventually lost motivation for it, and I decided
				sooner rather than later to switch my concept to something new to avoid any potential regrets.
				So I went back to the drawing board.
			</p>
			<p>To get inspiration, I looked through my Steam library and checked out games I've been sinking the most
				hours into lately. Two stood out immediately: DayZ and Sons of the Forest. Both are survival games, and
				that’s when it clicked. I’ve always been drawn to survival games. Something cool about survival games
				that has always intrigued me is that all survival games at their base are the same, managing stats,
				upgrading gear, crafting tools and armour, staying alive; they all do it in their own ways, which makes
				each one unique and fun in its own way.
				In Dayz, the story is more in the background. It's a zombie apocalypse with a heavy PvP focus. You're
				constantly on edge, scavenging and trying to survive while avoiding (or confronting) other players, and
				when you do, your heart will race faster than you could imagine. It's chaotic, unpredictable and
				honestly, stressful in a good way. I focus heavily on trying to survive.
			</p>
			<p>While Sons of the Forest, on the other hand, leans much more into the narrative. Sure, you still have to
				scavenge and survive like in Dayz, but here’s also a stronger sense of mystery and story progression
				that keeps you hooked differently.</p>
			<p>And then there's another game I've been playing recently: Subnautica. It's also a survival game, but it
				stands out for its focus on exploration, crafting and base building within a completely different
				environment compared to other survival games out there, due to it being purely set underwater. There’s a
				bit of story in there, too, but the way it balances survival and creativity makes it satisfying to play.
			</p>
			<p>Out of all three, I think Subnautica is one I enjoy most, especially when I think about it from a game
				development perspective. The building aspect, in particular, really appeals to me. </p>
			<p>After putting my understanding on survival games and what I like about them, I've settled on the idea of
				creating a survival game that focuses heavily on crafting and scavenging, which appeals to me about the
				building aspect. To make my game unique, I envision a time traveller who can only go back in time and
				has found themselves stranded on a prehistoric Earth. In this world with no agriculture, players will
				need to craft tools and survive, using a survival guide device that you had with you when you fell back
				in time, but also your time machine that you can use to get out of tricky situations, solve problems
				that may be scattered around the map.</p>
			<p>The rewind time mechanic could be cool, but because it will take up so much time, I want to focus on the
				game basics of a survival game. Then once I have that, I can move on to creating a story, working on
				time travel mechanics. </p>

			<h3>What made me curious about my game idea, and how can I explore that curiosity further?</h3>
			<p>What made me curious about my game idea this week was the concept of time travel and how it could change
				the mechanics of a survival game. I started to think about how I could implement the time machine
				mechanic to create interesting puzzles throughout the game. Additionally, I considered how it could be
				used as a tool when fighting enemies.</p>
			<p>When thinking about enemies, I imagined them as cavemen, dinosaurs, or animals that lived alongside
				primitive humans. With this in mind, I can explore multiple ways to utilise the time machine and see
				what works best, including whether I need to implement a cooldown period for its use.</p>
