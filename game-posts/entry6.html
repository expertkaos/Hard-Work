			<p>This is the last week to study for the ICAW exam. So, this week was all about exploring, and we have yet
				to learn any new topics.</p>

			<p>The process I used to prepare for my upcoming exam next week was to research game genres and the first
				games to have them. It was pretty hard to study for the right thing as we did not know the exam. We just
				had a rough idea of the topic and ensured that we were well-educated. I knew that writing was not my
				strong point, so I put extra time into studying for the exam.</p>
