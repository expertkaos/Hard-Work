			<p>This week in our game development class, we delved into the intricate world of narrative design.
				Narrative design is a fundamental aspect of game development that shapes a game’s storyline, characters,
				and overall progression.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="body" id="content">

			<p>Within this week, we first had a presentation on narrative design and its effect on a game. The
				presentation began with a preface emphasising that narrative design is not a one-size-fits-all approach.
				Different games adopt various strategies based on their unique needs and goals. Exploring insights from
				developers’ talks at the Games Developer Conference (GDC) was recommended to gain diverse perspectives.
			</p>

			<p>The game narrative design integrates elements, such as art, characters, emotion, music, and sound
				effects, to convey a compelling story. At its core, it immerses players in a narrative experience that
				complements gameplay.</p>

			<h3>Implementing Narrative Design: The 4 Layers</h3>

			<p>The presentation introduced a structured approach to implementing narrative design through four layers of
				interactive storytelling:</p>

			<p><b>1. Gameplay</b>: Actions and controls should align with the player’s expectations and provide clear
				feedback.</p>
			<p><b>2. Narrative Goal</b>: Every action or puzzle in the game should tie back to a narrative purpose,
				ensuring that player actions feel meaningful and logical within the game world.</p>
			<p><b>3. Narrative Background</b>: To avoid breaking immersion, the game environment should support the
				narrative through subtle cues like art, music, and dialogue without unnecessarily interrupting active
				gameplay.</p>
			<p><b>4. Mental Modeling</b>: Encouraging players to build a mental model of the game world through
				interactions that reinforce their understanding and suspension of disbelief.</p>

			<p>In many games, a design similar to the four-layer model is implemented.</p>

			<h3>Exploring the 4-Layers Model in Game Development: A Deep Dive into Portal</h3>

			<p>In the world of game development, creating a seamless blend of gameplay and narrative is a challenging
				yet rewarding task. One effective approach to achieve this is the 4-Layers model, introduced by Thomas
				Grip and Adrian Chmielarz. This model focuses on integrating gameplay and storytelling to create a
				cohesive and immersive experience. Let’s take a closer look at how this model can be applied to one of
				the most iconic moments in the game <b>Portal</b> and imagine a new challenge using the same approach.
			</p>

			<h3>Existing Moment: Final Battle with GLaDOS</h3>

			<p><b>1. Gameplay</b>: The player needs to destroy GLaDOS by using the portal gun to redirect rockets and
				incinerate her cores.</p>
			<p><b>2. Narrative Goal</b>: The player is motivated to defeat GLaDOS to escape the Aperture Science
				facility and uncover the truth behind the experiments.</p>
			<p><b>3. Narrative Background</b>: Throughout the game, the player has been receiving cryptic messages and
				learning about the dark history of Aperture Science, which builds up to this climactic confrontation.
			</p>
			<p><b>4. Mental Modeling</b>: The player’s actions align with the story as they use their acquired skills
				and knowledge to outsmart GLaDOS, making the gameplay and narrative feel cohesive.</p>

			<p>This moment is a perfect example of how the 4-Layers model can create a rich and engaging experience by
				intertwining gameplay mechanics with narrative elements.</p>

			<h3>New Challenge: Escape the Collapsing Facility</h3>

			<p>Now, let’s imagine adding a new challenge to Portal using the 4-Layers model:</p>

			<p><b>1. Gameplay</b>: After defeating GLaDOS, the player must navigate through a collapsing facility using
				the portal gun to reach the surface.</p>
			<p><b>2. Narrative Goal</b>: The player needs to escape the collapsing facility before it completely falls
				apart.</p>
			<p><b>3. Narrative Background</b>: As the player progresses, they encounter remnants of previous test
				subjects and more clues about the facility’s experiments, deepening the story.</p>
			<p><b>4. Mental Modeling</b>: The player’s actions, such as solving puzzles and avoiding hazards, are
				directly tied to the narrative of escaping the facility, creating a seamless experience.</p>

			<p>By adding this new challenge, we can extend the gameplay and further integrate the narrative, making the
				player’s journey even more immersive and engaging.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>

			<p>The 4-Layers model is a powerful tool for game developers looking to create a cohesive and immersive
				experience. We can see how this approach can enhance gameplay and storytelling by examining iconic
				moments in games like Portal and imagining new challenges. </p>

			<h3>What were you most proud of?</h3>

			<p>I was most proud of my ability to understand and apply the 4-Layers model to a well-known game like
				Portal. Seeing how the model can enhance gameplay and storytelling was satisfying.</p>

			<h3>Which activities helped you learn the most?</h3>

			<p>The presentation on narrative design and the discussion on the 4-Layers model were particularly helpful.
				Analysing the final battle with GLaDOS in Portal and imagining a new challenge using the model made the
				concepts clear and practical.</p>

			<h3>Where did you encounter struggles and what did you do to deal with it?</h3>

			<p>One struggle was understanding how to seamlessly integrate the narrative background without interrupting
				gameplay. To deal with this, I reviewed examples from the presentation and discussed them with
				classmates to gain a better understanding.</p>
