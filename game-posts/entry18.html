		<div class="body" id="overview">
			<p>This week we were assigned to continue discussing narrative design in one of our favourite games.
				However, since I already covered this topic last week, I decided to get a head start on next week’s
				tasks. The upcoming tasks involve two components: a practical one using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and a
				theoretical one, which we’ll continue through slides and discussions on design.</p>

		<div class="body" id="content">
			<p>To prepare, I installed UE5 and got more familiar with the interface. Although I have used UE5 in a
				previous game development course, we only scratched the surface and didn’t write any code. This time, I
				aimed to dive deeper and explore more of its features.</p>
			<p>First, I revisited the basics of the UE5 interface. I explored the different panels, such as the Content
				Browser, Details panel, and the World Outliner. Understanding these components is crucial for efficient
				navigation and project management within UE5.</p>
			<p>One of the most exciting aspects of UE5 is its Blueprint system, which allows for visual scripting. I
				created simple Blueprints to get a feel for how they work. This included setting up basic interactions
				and understanding how to use nodes to control game logic without writing traditional code.</p>
			<p>To put my knowledge into practice, I created a simple scene. I added various assets, adjusted their
				properties, and experimented with lighting and materials. This hands-on approach helped me understand
				how different elements create a cohesive environment. However, I did not have anything to show for it.

			<h3>What are your next steps?</h3>
			<p>Next week, I plan to delve deeper into UE5 by working on more complex Blueprints and starting to write
				some code. Additionally, I will continue to engage with the theoretical component of our course,
				focusing on design principles and how they can be applied in practical scenarios.</p>

			<h3>If you could do this week over, what would you do differently?</h3>
			<p>If I could do this week over, I would spend more time experimenting with different Blueprint nodes and
				interactions to understand visual scripting in UE5 better.</p>

			<h3>Did you give your best effort on this?</h3>
			<p>I gave my best effort by thoroughly exploring the UE5 interface and experimenting with Blueprints. I
				aimed to understand each component and how it contributes to the game development process.</p>
