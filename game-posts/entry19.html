			<p>This week, we started installing and learning how to use Unreal Engine 5. Last week, I did the same and
				created something within UE5 to develop my skills further. Additionally, we're following a slightly
				different structure this week, which I find a better fit. Each week, we will have a practical component
				we can do in our own time; in this case, it is learning how to use UE5. Furthermore, we will have a
				weekly theory component to understand what makes a good game. This is important because knowing only the
				practical aspects of making a game work can take us so far. This week's theory component is "Immersion
				by Design." We discussed how to make a game immersive and its impact. After our class, we were tasked to
				discuss a game we had previously played. Furthermore, we were asked to examine the levels of immersion
				that we felt while playing it and explain why we think it is immersive.</p>

			<p>This week, I bought and started playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While playing, I was thinking about
				the game's immersive nature. The game certainly focuses on immersion right from the beginning. It is
				designed to provide a deeply immersive experience, focusing on discovery and living through a nightmare.
				It puts you in the shoes of Daniel, who wakes up in a desolate castle with little memory of his past.
				The game utilises techniques to mimic how disoriented Daniel feels; the vision is unsteady, and the
				camera is angled in a way that makes looking around strange. The first-person perspective and lack of
				combat make players feel vulnerable, and environmental storytelling combines to create an immersive and
				psychologically intense experience.</p>
			<p>In our theory class, we discussed psychological states. The psychological states are the various mental
				and emotional conditions players experience while playing. These states can significantly impact a
				player’s engagement, enjoyment, and overall gaming experience. I felt mostly worried when playing
				Amnesia: The Dark Descent for the first time, experiencing low skill and a medium challenge level.</p>
			<p>During the practical component of the week, I continued my experimentation with UE5. I followed a
				tutorial on creating my first game within UE5. The tutorial focused on creating a basic game using the
				UE game sample ‘Stack O Bot’. This sample is a small sandbox project that demonstrates a simple player
				controller, an expandable interaction system, and modular pieces that can be built upon. It also
				showcases all the new features of Unreal Engine 5 in a practical vertical slice.</p>

			<h3>Where did you encounter struggles while learning UE5, and what did you do to deal with them?</h3>
			<p>I encountered difficulties with using UE5 because many tutorials and resources are restricted, which
				forces me to use it at home or consume a lot of mobile data. Additionally, I've noticed that my laptop
				struggles with UE5, and some basic tasks take longer to complete because I have to wait for my computer
				to catch up. To avoid this issue, I simply use my laptop at home where I can access all resources and
				encounter no processing power problems.</p>

			<h3>What were you most proud of in your work with Unreal Engine 5 this week?</h3>
			<p>I was most proud of successfully creating a basic game using the ‘Stack O Bot’ sample and understanding
				how to implement various features within UE5.</p>

			<h3>Did this week’s activities with Unreal Engine 5 help you learn more than previous activities?</h3>
			<p>Yes, this week’s activities with UE5 provided hands-on experience and practical knowledge, which helped
				me learn more effectively than previous activities.</p>
