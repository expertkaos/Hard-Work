		<div class="body" id="overview">
			<p>This week, we didn't cover any theory; instead, we focused entirely on practical learning by delving
				deeper into Unreal Engine. While working on a new tutorial, I realised I had primarily used blueprints
				and hadn't done much coding. So, I decided to learn how to code within Unreal Engine 5, which uses C++.
				I have relatively little experience with C++, as I've only tinkered with a variant used by Arduino.
				Therefore, I decided to take a course on C++, as I believe it will help me with coding in the future.

			<p>This is the course that I followed to learn how to code within C++ (will need a login): <a

			<p>The second course that I followed this week: <a target="_blank"

		<div class="body" id="content">
			<p>The first course closely resembles problems on platforms like Grok or Leet Code, where you are given a
				problem/example and can input your solution. Like every code learning course, it starts with printing
				the phrase ‘hello world’.</p>
