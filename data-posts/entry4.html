			<p>This week we got assigned a new word document Word document, which covered revision for object-oriented
				programming finite state machines and logic gates. I wanted to finish the article this week so that I
				could start working on the Part 1 and Part 2 questions next week.</p>

			<p>I began by going over the <b>Implementation Model</b> in <b>Part 1</b>. We had to read an article about
				<b>logic gates</b>, <b>inheritance</b>, and <b>code circuits</b> for <b>Part 1</b>. I'll try to clarify
				this week's work journal piece.
			</p>

			<p>The article discusses <b>inheritance</b> in <b>object-oriented programming</b>, comparing it to
				real-world inheritance processes. Python allows for subclasses and superclasses by allowing child
				classes to inherit behavior and data from parent classes. An <b>inheritance hierarchy</b> illustrates
				the links between built-in collections, with a list being a child of a collection.</p>

			<p>The lesson continues by demonstrating how to create a Python simulation of a digital circuit, which I
				will replicate side by side in Visual Studio. Like what we did last week, only in code, the simulations
				are essentially just logic gates with boolean algebra relationships between their inputs and outputs.
				The input values dictate the output value of the gates, which have a single output line.</p>

			<h3>Did you come to class prepared to learn, in both your attitude and with all your supplies?</h3>
			<p>Since I adore IT and find it to be a subject I truly like more than others, I did came to class ready to
				learn, both mentally and physically. In addition, I always carry a computer and an extra adapter in case
				we need them for any reason. This is all that is necessary for IT work.</p>

			<p>In my experience, it is more effective to learn a new topic by absorbing some information and then
				engaging in related tasks rather than reading a large amount of text and attempting to complete a task.
				I prefer this method because when you read a lot of text, a significant portion of it tends to be
				forgotten. However, when you learn something and then put it into practice, it gets drilled into your
				brain, and you tend to retain the information better. You also learn some extra details when you work on
				tasks related to the new topic.</p>
