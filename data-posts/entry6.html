				To prepare for my data science exam next week, I looked into different ways to analyse data and the
				first big studies that used them. It was tough to know exactly what to study because we didn’t have many
				details about the exam. I just made sure to learn about a lot of different areas. I also spent more time
				on how to explain data results because that’s something I want to get better at.
