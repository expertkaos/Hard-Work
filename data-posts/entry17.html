		<div class="body" id="overview">
			<p>During the first week of the new semester, we started with an overview of what we would cover in this
				class. The assigned work for this week involved delving deeper into Matplotlib and exploring how it
				organises plots using figures and axes, which is essential for creating detailed visualisations.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="body" id="content">

			<p>I started by exploring how to use different colours for various data series. By applying colours like
				red, green, and blue to other functions, I could easily distinguish between them, making my plots
				clearer and more informative.</p>

			<p>I also delved into markers and line styles to add more detail to my plots. Using markers such as circles,
				crosses, squares, and line styles like solid, dashed, and dash-dot helped make my plots more engaging
				and visually appealing.</p>

			<p>One of the highlights was combining these styles to create a more complex plot. I made a plot with a
				dotted red line and large yellow diamond markers with a green edge. This fun exercise showed how
				different styles can work together to create an attractive and informative visualisation.</p>

			<p>Additionally, I discovered how to set global styles using Matplotlib’s configuration options. This allows
				me to change the default look of all my plots at once, ensuring a consistent style across my work.</p>

			<p>I also explored colourmaps, which are used to represent data with colours. Learning to choose and apply
				colourmaps will make plots more readable and informative.</p>

			<h3>Why do you believe we’re studying this?</h3>

			<p>We’re studying this to enhance our ability to present data clearly and informally. Visualisations are
				crucial in many fields, and mastering tools like Matplotlib helps us communicate complex data
				effectively.</p>

			<h3>What about your thinking, learning, or work satisfied you most? Why?</h3>

			<p>Creating a complex plot with a dotted red line and large yellow diamond markers with a green edge brought
				me the most satisfaction. Seeing how different styles could work together to create an attractive and
				informative visualisation was rewarding.</p>

			<h3>Did you come to class prepared to learn, in your attitude and with all your supplies?</h3>

			<p>Yes, I came to class with a positive attitude and all the necessary supplies, including my laptop and
				notes. Being prepared helped me stay focused and engaged during the lessons.</p>
