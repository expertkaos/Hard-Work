			<p>This was the final week of my project, so I had to wrap things up. I spent time finding the right data

				my work. After analysing everything, I wrote down my findings.</p>

			<p>At the beginning of the week, I worked on a dataset related to an anime streaming service. This dataset
				included information about all the anime available on the platform, their reviews and various data
				points. It contained details about each user, including the films they watched and their average
				reviews. I used this data to identify patterns, but despite numerous attempts and the creation of many
				graphs, I couldn't find anything significant. Eventually, I abandoned that dataset and looked for a new
				one. That's when I came across a dataset on crimes in Chicago, which included every reported incident
				from 2001 to 2017. This dataset contained over a million entries, and I figured I could extract some
				interesting insights from it. </p>
			<img class="small-img" src="data_evidence/entry_30/evidence_2.png">
			<p>I analysed the data and created graphs to identify patterns. I generated multiple data points and
				discovered interesting results, but the most notable was the graph below, which illustrated the total
				number of crimes each year, plotted against each month. I observed that not only did crime rates decline
				over the years, but they also tended to decrease around February and increase in July. I suspected this
				was related to the onset of summer in Chicago.</p>
			<img class="small-img" src="data_evidence/entry_30/evidence_3.png">
			<p>To support my hypothesis, I gathered another dataset that included weather data for U.S. cities,
				including Chicago, from 2012 to 2017. I incorporated this weather data into my previous graph and found
				that it aligned with my findings. This led me to conclude that crime rates in Chicago tend to increase
				during the summer months.</p>

			<h3>If I were to redo this project, how would I approach it differently?</h3>
			<p>My project timeline was unbalanced; I left almost no time to complete the work and spent most of my time
				bogged down. While finding a good dataset is important, I focused too much on that aspect. If I were to
				do this project again, I would create a detailed plan outlining what I need to accomplish each week.
				This approach would help me understand what tasks need to be completed and allow me to break the larger
				project into smaller, more manageable parts. This would make me feel less overwhelmed and prevent me
				from avoiding the work because it’s too difficult.</p>

			<h3>Did I encounter any challenges in identifying trends and patterns? How did I overcome them?</h3>
			<p>I had difficulties identifying significant patterns in the anime dataset. After several attempts, I
				switched to a different dataset—specifically, the Chicago crime data. This new dataset revealed clearer
				trends, especially when combined with weather data. This experience taught me the importance of being
				flexible and willing to pivot when necessary.</p>

			<h3>How did I handle unexpected challenges or setbacks during the project?</h3>
			<p>Despite conducting several analyses, I encountered setbacks with the anime dataset, which did not provide
				significant insights. Rather than getting stuck, I decided to switch to the Chicago crime dataset. This
				change enabled me to uncover meaningful patterns and successfully complete my analysis on time.</p>
