			<p>This week, we have been preparing for ICAW (in-class assessment week), which is scheduled for two weeks.
				Our exam will focus on the ethical management of data. Over the next two weeks, we will be delving into
				the Ethical Management of Data to prepare adequately for the upcoming examination.</p>

			<p>During the week, I read a document about the ethical management of data and Centrelink's Robodebt
				situation. The document talks about managing data ethically. It says that as technology advances,
				ethical boundaries are often replaced with moral ones, creating new problems, such as protecting
				people's privacy and being fair with data. Thinking about these issues carefully is essential,
				especially since technology is becoming more critical.</p>

			<p>The document then discusses Centrelink's Robodebt situation. The Robodebt scheme was a perfect example of
				data used unethically. Centrelink is the Australian government department that controls welfare
				payments.</p>

			<p>The document then discusses Centrelink's Robodebt situation. The Robodebt scheme was a perfect example of
				data used unethically. Centrelink is the Australian government department that controls welfare
				payments. Welfare payments are government aid for people experiencing financial difficulties, usually in
				the case of unemployment. When someone becomes unemployed, they contact Centrelink. Then, they will
				supply a small income to the individual, but after they get a job, some forget to tell Centrelink and
				still receive the money. It is someone's job to find overpaid people and investigate the matter by
				contacting the person's employer. If they are, the investigator will file a bill; this works but is slow
				and costly. Therefore, Centrelink came up with the idea to automate the process. The automation process
				was named 'Robodebt'. A computer program cannot investigate how a person can; it would be impossible to
				gather the person's employment by the employer they used the ATO.</p>

			<p>On a personal note, I approached my classes enthusiastically and was ready to learn. My passion for IT
				and the subject matter made it easy to engage with the material. I made sure to come prepared mentally
				and with all the necessary supplies, including my computer and an extra adapter.
			<p>
			<p>My learning strategy of absorbing and applying information immediately through related tasks has been
				effective. It’s a method that helps me retain knowledge better than simply reading large amounts of
				text. This approach has been validated this week, as I’ve remembered more and understood the nuances of
				the topics at hand.</p>
