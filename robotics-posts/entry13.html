			<p>This week is the final week before submitting my project, so I must ensure everything is complete. This
				includes 3D printing the case for my controller, soldering the components onto the PCB scheduled to
				arrive this Friday, and writing code to ensure that the PCB and components work together. Since my PCB
				has been in transit since last week after I sent it off for fabrication, I focused on 3D printing the
				casing at the beginning of the week. Once the PCB arrives, I will solder the components together.</p>

			<p>First thing i did this week was load up onshape which is a cloud-based CAD platform that allows users to
				create a collaborate 3D models in real time from anydevice, making it an ideal for me since i work on my
				home computer and my laptop, i have worked with CAD in the past when I got my 3D printer so i did not
				have to lurn how to onshape so i could go straight into it. I first chose Onshape as the CAD because it
				was cloud-based. Still, also its free i could have used Fusion 360, which is one of the best CAD’s out
				there but its not free and comes at quite a price although since i am a student i would able to use it
				for free but after i graduate i will have to pay so i decided to use a cad that i can use for free
				forever.

			<p>The controller's shape can be quite curvy and is not a simple box. Although I could have made a box, I
				wanted to give myself a little challenge for the extra comfort it would give me.
				The way that OnShape works is very simple. At its basics, you draw a scratch, a 2D drawing of shapes
				with dimensions, and then you can extend it to get three dimensions. This makes rectangular shapes easy
				to make in Onshape. I did the same thing for my design, except I used a spline, a multi-point curve,
				allowing me to have a curvy shape.
			</p>
			<p>I created sketches of all three faces—top, side, and front- to achieve a curvy shape from every angle. I
				then extruded each face and retained only the volume overlapping all three sketches. The image above
				illustrates these top, side, and front sketches. By doing this, I got the shape of the main body of the
				controller. With this, the model had some sharp edges, so I used the fillet tool to curve the edges to
				make it more comfortable to hold.
			</p>

			<p>After making the basic shape of the controller, it was time to make the controller contain my PCB that I
				have been working on for the past few weeks the idea for this is simple make a hole inside the
				controller and then put a few holes in to allow parts of the pcb to stick out like the joysticks
				antanina led switch and usb programer out the back.
			</p>
			<p>I used the same method as before to create a sketch instead of extruding it to achieve this. However,
				this time, I am not adding material; I am removing it. The first step was to create the main hole for
				the PCB to fit into. I measured the width and length of the PCB design and then constructed a simple box
				that would hold the PCB. The next part was straightforward; I measured the sizes of the components and
				designed a larger shape to accommodate each component. By the end of creating all these shapes, I had
				various parts that I now needed to remove from the main body (as seen in the image below). In the past,
				when I designed in Onshape, I simplified the process by using the same tool to extrude, but switched it
				from "add" to "remove." However, with this many shapes, that approach didn't seem appropriate. Instead,
				I chose the "add" option and then combined all the shapes using a Boolean operation. I then removed the
				mass from the main body using the same boolean.
			</p>

			<p>After some ttweking of position and size of the holes i was pretty happy with the looks of the
				controller, but the new problem was to actually get the model printed for a 3d printer to work well you
				need to have a flat part of the modlol on the ground so the print can stick to the base plat also with
				this you want as minimal overhang as possible which is parts of the print that the printer will have to
				print in the air rather than onto already part of the print having this happen will make the print
				really messy one way to avoid it is to put in supports for the print which just is some easy tear away
				plastic that holds up the over hang but the best way is just not to have any over hang at all.</p>
			<p>The way that the shape is i can just print it all at once there is no large fla part touching the base
				plat there is too much overhang and i need a way to put the pcb into the print this fix is very easy all
				i need to do was cut the model in half and now facing both cut faces down this solve al the previous
				issues no minimal overhang a way to put the pcb in and a flat surface to put on the baseplate of the 3D
				printer.
				But with cutting the print in two comes a new problem, since the print is now in two parts instead of
				the one i need a way to put them back together after the print is done i dont want to just glue the
				parts together because i will want to be able to take my pcb in and out that when screws where a good
				option.
				To allow for screws i need to make screw holes inside the print this was pretty straight forward and i
				used the same technure to remove as i did with the main hole in the end i had 6 screw holes in total to
				the same size as the screws that i have.
			</p>

			<p>After some tweaking of everything i was pretty happy but then i relised that i completely forgot about
				the 9volt battery that i needed to power my pcb so i needed to make a new extruded part out of the
				bottom on the controller when making this found its much eser to just create new parts and add them
				together with a boolean when dealing with more complicated creations so i added a rectangular prism big
				enough to fit the bateryinside mad a smaller rectangular prism inside the other one to with two pointing
				out at the top to give a space to run a cable through to also be albe to put a new battery in and out i
				added a lid to the bater box by splitting the box in half and adding two more screw holes. </p>
