			<p>This entry covers the first two weeks of this course. Within these two weeks, we first covered the
				structure of this class, which mainly consisted of creating a project that we would be working on and
				later presenting on it. After a brief of the class overview, we were instructed to brainstorm our
				project.</p>

			<p>I had some ideas floating around, but I eventually settled on creating a plane and a controller that two
				Arduinos would control. As it is quite a challenging task, I have decided to tackle it with one of my
				peers to divide the workload. We agreed that I would create the controller and my partner would work on
				the plane.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started watching videos on similar projects to help me better understand how I would approach the task
				of making the controller and the components I would need. On a basic level, all I need is two joysticks,
				a transmitter module and an Arduino; with this, I can control the throttle and the steering, but later
				on, I can also add an LCD and a potentiometer so I can change the channel code easily and having it
				shown on the LCD this will also hopefully allow finding signals for other RC vehicles also adding a
				switch as an arm switch could also be a good idea so the plane does not turn on accidentally and if in a
				emergency it needs to turn off.
			</p>
			<p>As I wanted to implement an LCD into my project and had never played with one before, I tried to figure
				out how it works. The best way to do this is to do a tiny project that involves an LCD. The project I
				decided to do for this is a counter that the number goes up when a button is pressed. </p>
