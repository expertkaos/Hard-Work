		<div class="body" id="overview">
			<p>This week was one of the most productive weeks that I have had in a while. This is because this week I
				finally finished and sent of my PCB, but not to my knowledge at the time, this would be a much harder
				thing to get completed. To get my PCB in time to present my project, i needed to send of my board to get
				made so i set myself a deadline of sunday to have it finssished and bought. Still, my design was no way
				near to finssihing in the previous weeks i learnt how to use kikad the cad for pcb added the symbols and
				assigned footprints to each symbol but when it came to laying out the trakes i found alot of trouble to
				get them in a make that sense without going over all over the boad to tackle my problems with this i
				reached out to a family friend steve was more than happy to hand of some knowledge on pcb design after
				years of experience.</p>
